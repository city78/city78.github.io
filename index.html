<h4 style="display:inline;font-size:large;">Mission</h4></br></br>

<span><h4 style="display:inline;font-size:medium;">Organic place identity development</h4> is essential in achieving a 
thriving and successful urban space; it is a precursor for attracting tourism, investments, talent and trade in an 
increasingly globalizing and competitive world.</br></br>
The economic importance of managing place identity and how it informs urban economic performance is what drives us 
to design models that define and refine the most effective mix of uses in order to achieve sustainable communities 
and maximize competitive advantage for urban areas.</br></br></span>

<h4 style="display:inline;font-size:large;">How</h4></br></br>


              <span><h4 style="display:inline;font-size:medium;">We are fascinated with the idea of an organic city</h4>,
								one that breathes, grows, and repairs itself.
								An organic city is only as effective as its own feedback channels from its respective parts.</br></br></span>
<span><h4 style="display:inline;font-size:large;">City78</h4> aims to bring life to these feedback channels and help organizations understand
the communities around them, both those that are mapped as well as those that are unmapped yet have organically
mapped themselves, through data-driven community and spatial listening. Using a mix of
traditional urban planning and research techniques along with geospatial clustering
algorithms and NLP tools, we bring together the best analytical practices from the
20th and 21st centuries to create high-level urban analysis reports through in-depth analysis of data a granular level.

</li><p>	Theo is a mixed media and data visualization artist.
	His visualizations frequently analyze and explore network and longitudinal data from open
	data sources and web scrapers. Theo's mixed media pieces deal with interaction
	with data through physical, three-dimensional spaces and auditory mediums, and
	are influenced by the idea of making data intuitive to the viewer as well as his interest in biomimicry. </br></br>As a supporter
	of open data, he regularly contributes datasets to data.world. His thesis for
	the Georgetown Government Honors Program examined the rapid expansion of national
	open data initiatives globally, which he defended in May 2017, receiving honors with distinction. </p>
